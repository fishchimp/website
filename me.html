      <p>
        Hi there, my name is Muhammad Hafizh Hasyim but you can call me Hafizh.
        I am a first year international student at ANU studying Bachelors of
        Advanced Computing from Indonesia.

      <p>
        When my parents brought me to tech/gadget stores back in 2010 to
        jailbreak their iPads and iPhones, I instantly became intrigued by the
        idea of "hacking" and having more control of our personal devices.
        Though I've never attempted to learn coding till Year 12 of high school,
        I have always been interested in how programs and code could make
        complex software in gadgets and the internet.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Other than my passion in technology, I also have interests in
        architecture, automobile, and nature landscape which you can find
        <a href="gallery.html">here</a>.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3 class="heading">Hobbies</h3>
      <p>
        For my hobbies, I try to balance my life with enough learning fulfilment
        and also enjoyment. Which is also how I have customised my daily
        routine. Some hobbies that I enjoy doing:
