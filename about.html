      At the beginning of the course, I had some expectations on what I should
      or will study as I have self-taught myself the basics of HTML and CSS. I
      was quite excited to take the course as my trivial knowledge of web design
      would give me a big picture of how the course would go and be of help in
      the early weeks as I would have had a small head start. Looking back, I
      feel that I have learnt many things about web design, both the coding and
      overall approach as well as how web development is in the industry.
    </p>

      Students were asked to choose their topic at the beginning of the course.
      Thus, I decided to create a personal website so I would be motivated
      enough to maintain it in the future and use it as an e-portfolio once I
      garner experience and internships. Through the first few weeks, I studied
      the basics of HTML and CSS which at the time I had already learned.
      Therefore, assignment part 1 was not that difficult for me as the
      expectations of the submitted website were clear and my previous knowledge
      in HTML and CSS helped.
    </p>

      The second third of the semester was where I had to learn more advanced
      CSS rules as well as incorporate some JavaScript as it was required for
      the second part of the assignment. Learning JavaScript to create a photo
      gallery was arguably the most difficult part of assignment part 2. It
      required extensive research on the basics of JavaScript and references on
      other websites. Unfortunately, the course did not teach much JavaScript
      during the labs and students were referred to online resources most of the
      time. Though I had expected to do some self-research, doing so for a major
      part of the marking rubric was quite stressful. However, I managed to
      incorporate some JavaScript and tried to learn as much as I could by
      changing the code and seeing how it would change the behaviour of the
      website. Though I wish I could have had more time to fix some bugs in my
      JavaScript, the process of learning JavaScript was quite fun and
      fulfilling.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      In the last third of the semester, students were asked to improve their
      website, future-proof it, and were given the freedom to do something
      'original'. Overall, learning web development through this course has been
      a fun experience and has made me interested in learning it deeper.
